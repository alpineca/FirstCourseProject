# Knights Rows

The game begins with the release of four fighters. Each of them has different abilities. One of them can plant bombs in buildings, another allows you to cross the boundaries of the map, 
the third keeps the group from being killed by the surrounding enemy. The fourth reduces the likelihood that the group will be hit by the enemy.

The goal of the game is for the group to be able to destroy all the buildings before they are killed by the enemy. In order for a building to be successfully demolished,
all its columns (marked with an "X") must be demolished.
